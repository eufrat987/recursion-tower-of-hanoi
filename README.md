# Recursion by example

Project show recursion in action with non-trivial problem - solving tower of hanoi.

## Most common trivial problems are calculation of:
- factorial - 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
- nth fibbonaci number - 1,1,2,3,5,8,...

# Tower of hanoi
The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, 
the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. 

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:

- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
